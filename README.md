# DISH 
**DISH (Deep Intelligence for Source Handling)** is a hybrid deep learning pipeline designed for source finding and handling of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas in galaxies. The pipeline combines supervised learning and unsupervised learning models to detect and characterize HI emission in data cubes from the Looking At the Distant Universe with the MeerKAT Array (LADUMA) survey.

The name DISH is inspired by the radio dishes of radio telescopes used in radio astronomy, highlighting the project's connection to radio observations of HI gas.
# Background
Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) is of particular interest to astronomers due to its role as a fundamental tracer of galactic structure and evolution. The 21-cm emission line from HI allows astronomers to better map the distribution of gas within and around galaxies, offering critical insights into various processes such as star formation, gas accretion, and galaxy interactions throughout cosmic time. 
# Objective
The LADUMA survey is the deepest HI survey to date, aiming to observe HI in galaxies out to redshifts greater than 1. A key challenge arises when observing galaxies at higher redshifts, as HI emission becomes increasingly faint and difficult to detect due to factors such as cosmological redshift, decreased signal-to-noise ratios, and the intrinsic dimming of HI brightness with distance. DISH is designed to address this problem by leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance the detection and classification of HI sources in noisy observational data.
