# DISH
DISH (Deep Intelligence for Source Handling) is a hybrid deep learning pipeline designed for source finding and handling of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas in galaxies. The pipeline combines supervised learning (CNN) and unsupervised anomaly detection (autoencoders) to detect and characterize HI emission in FITS data cubes from the LADUMA survey.
